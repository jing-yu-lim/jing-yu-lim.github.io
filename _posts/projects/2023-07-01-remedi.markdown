In the busy schedule of today's life, a number of people does not want to go to hospitals. This is why, we propose ReMeDi, an end-to-end system that handles routine check and doctor interaction. It uses AI powered chatbot to talk to patients about symptoms and suggests tests. On the other hand, doctors can monitor their patients on the dashboard and can quickly take actions if needed. We thank Tazneen Tamanna for her contribution to the early part of this project.
