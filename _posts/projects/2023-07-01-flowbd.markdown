Supply chain management is important for businesses as it manages the flow of goods and materials from production to consumption. However, the current system has problems that can cause inefficiencies, delays, and increased costs. To fix these issues, we plan to use blockchain and IoT technology to automate the supply chain and create a more efficient, cost-effective, transparent, and secure system. Our solution combines the digital, virtual, and physical worlds with RFID, blockchain, and IoT technology as part of Industry 4.0.
