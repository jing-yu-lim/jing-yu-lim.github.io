We uncover a performance assymetry of Model-Based RL agents on the Atari100k benchmark which is especially pronounced in pixel-based agents. We propose Joint Embedding DIffusion (JEDI) World Model to capture both the visual modeling power of diffusion models as well as the action temporal reasoning capabilities of latent world models.
