Incorporating MaskGIT as a dynamics prior to enhance sequence modeling in world models, we address the limitation of transformer-based world models in continuous action environments and the inadequacies of prior methods, like STORM, in capturing effective state representations,  suggesting that Masked Generative Priors could be a powerful inductive bias for world models, supporting broader applicability across diverse RL tasks and environments.
